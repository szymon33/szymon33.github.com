			<h3><em>Let&#8217;s talk about me</em></h3>
			<h4>I am a web developer</h4>
			<p>I&#8217;m a web developer who loves the web, beauty of code and things that are enjoyable to use. I am passionate about programming. Especially <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"
                                rel="external" title="Ruby On Rails">Ruby (on Rails)</a> and <a href="http://www.javascriptsource.com/" 
                                       rel="external" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. I am as excited by smart algorithms and I'm a maniac of simple and elegant solutions (which means: DRY, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" title="Keep It Simple, Stupid">KISS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better" title="worse is better">worse is better</a> etc.).
                        </p>
			<h4>Things I love</h4>
			<p>I have been called a &#8220;serial hobbyist.&#8221; There is so much to be interested in, to learn about, and to pour one&#8217;s creativity into. I spend time with my cat, bike, climbing, national football, photography, and traveling. There are a million things I want to try, to do, to be better at. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I&#8217;m really trying.</p>
			<h4>What I do</h4>
			<p>I work as a web developer and I try my best to make my customers happy. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me away from devloping a very long time.
                            But I always want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to <em>learn</em> more and get better.
                            I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.</p>

		<div class="contents" id="you">
			<h3><em>Let&#8217;s talk about you</em></h3>
			<h4>You are the best</h4>
			<p>You make <a href="http://www.basecamp.com/" rel="external" title="Basecamp">awesome products</a>, you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y" rel="external" title="Argument Clinic">piss people off</a>, and generally make the web a better place. Heck, some of you are even a <a href="http://szymon.tvn.pl/" rel="external" title="Szymon">Szymon</a>. </p>
			<h4>You need the best</h4>
			<p>You need a <strong>rock star</strong>. You need somebody that will tell you <strong>&#8220;no&#8221;</strong>, that will fight for an idea, and that isn&#8217;t such a fanboy that he won&#8217;t challenge years of what he has established as the way to do the web.</p>
			<p>I&#8217;ll be honest. There are tons of reasons not to try for this job. Sure, on the surface it sounds like a dream to work for. Your philosophy makes me say &#8220;right on&#8221; and the way you have described your work environment makes it sound exactly like the kind of place a creative person could soar. Who wouldn&#8217;t covet such an amazing opportunity? I certainly do, but it&#8217;s not all fun and games &#8212; this is a tough challenge. Redesigning your marketing websites and eventually changing the way you do business, will invite an incredible amount of scrutiny from thousands of users and bloggers. This is a position that requires a <strong>thick skin</strong>, <strong>amazing skills</strong>, and <strong>supernatural confidence</strong>.</p>
			<h4>I&#8217;m that guy</h4>
			<p>I didn&#8217;t make this page very lightly, and have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. <strong>I love a challenge</strong>. I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together. </p>
