        Szymon is a Polish version of the masculine given name Simonem (latinum) or Simon (english if you more familiar with). Not like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Simon" rel="external" title="Paul Simon">Simon</a>, nor this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simone_Simon" rel="external" title="Simone Simon">Simon</a>, and certainly <strong><em>not</em></strong> this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Peter" rel="external" title="Simon Peter">Simon</a>. I love to make things &#8212; especially websites. I think we should talk.

        <h1><em>Let&#8217;s talk about me</em></h1>
        <h2>I am a web developer</h2>
        <p>I&#8217;m a web developer who loves the web, beauty of both code and <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_interface' target='_blank'>UI</a> flows from good <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience' target='_blank'>UX</a>. I also believe that most of desktop apps are to be dead soon. I am passionate about programming. Especially <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/"
                                  rel="external" title="Ruby On Rails">Ruby (on Rails)</a> and <a href="http://www.javascriptsource.com/" 
                                         rel="external" title="JavaScript">JavaScript</a>. In fact, JavaScript is not my favourite programming language but it is considered essential for developing interactive or animated web functions. I am as excited by smart algorithms and I'm a maniac of simple and elegant solutions (which means: DRY, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle" title="Keep It Simple, Stupid">KISS</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worse_is_better" title="worse is better">worse is better</a> etc.).
                          </p>
        <h2>Things I love</h2>
        <p>Music, internet, bike, climbing, my cat, photography, and traveling. There is never enough time in the day, week, or year for everything; though I&#8217;m really trying.</p>
        <h2>What I do</h2>
        <p>I work as a web developer and I try my best to make my customers happy. Really, I cannot think of anything that would keep me away from devloping a very long time. But I always want more. Not necessarily stuff or money, but I want to <em>learn</em> more and get better. I want to keep the pressure up. I want to take on the toughest challenges.</p>

      <article class="R right">
        <h1><em>Let&#8217;s talk about you</em></h1>
        <h2>You are the best</h2>
        <p>You make <a href="http://www.basecamp.com/" rel="external" title="Basecamp">awesome products</a>, you <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kQFKtI6gn9Y" rel="external" title="Argument Clinic">piss people off</a>, and generally make the web a better place. Heck, some of you are even a <a href="http://szymon.tvn.pl/" rel="external" title="Szymon">Szymon</a>. </p>
        <h2>You need the best</h2>
        <p>You need a <strong>rock star</strong>. You need somebody that will tell you <strong>&#8220;no&#8221;</strong>, that will fight for an idea, and that isn&#8217;t such a fanboy that he won&#8217;t challenge years of what he has established as the way to do the web.</p>
<p>Developing your marketing websites and eventually changing the way you do business, will invite an incredible amount of scrutiny from thousands of users and bloggers. This is a position that requires a <strong>thick skin</strong>, <strong>amazing skills</strong>, and <strong>supernatural confidence</strong>.</p>
        <h2>I&#8217;m that guy</h2>
        <p>I didn&#8217;t make this page very lightly, it's responsive and have spent some time considering whether or not to really go for this. <strong>I love a challenge</strong>. I love the idea of working with people that are brilliant; whom I admire and respect. I know what it means to work together to make something great. I want to learn from you and I want to teach you and I want to learn things together. </p>
